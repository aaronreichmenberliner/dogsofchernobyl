# Radioactive contamination in feral dogs in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: Population body-burden survey and implications for human radiation exposure

This study represents the largest live-animal whole body counting experiment carried out in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and is the only study to examine feral dogs as a potential source of human radiation exposure in a contaminated area. This study is further valuable in that it seeks to answer a radiation safety question of rapidly growing importance, as activity in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone increases. This data can be of use for both site personnel safety and for further studies of radiation effects in this animal population. The methods described in this paper further set a precedent for body burden analysis in limited-resource environments which may be encountered at other nuclear incident sites (Marshall Islands, Semipalatinsk, EURT etc). Further research on contamination transfer will be carried out in the future, along with beta/gamma spectroscopy to determine the makeup of external radioisotope contamination encountered on these animals.

Currently in review. See preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.12.487820v1)
